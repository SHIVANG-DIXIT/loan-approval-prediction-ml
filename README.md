# loan-approval-prediction-ml
A machine learning project to predict loan approval status based on applicant details. Includes data preprocessing, EDA, and logistic regression modeling.
This project focuses on predicting whether a loan application will be approved based on various applicant details such as income, credit history, loan amount, marital status, and more.

The main objective is to build a reliable classification model that helps financial institutions automate and improve their loan approval process.

Cleaned and processed real-world loan data

Performed EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) to understand feature relationships

Handled missing values and encoded categorical variables

Trained a Logistic Regression model for binary classification

Evaluated model performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report

ðŸ§° Tools & Libraries Used:
Python, Pandas, NumPy

Scikit-learn (Logistic Regression)

Seaborn & Matplotlib (visualization)
